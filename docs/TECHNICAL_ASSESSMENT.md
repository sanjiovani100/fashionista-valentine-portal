# Technical Assessment & Planning

## 1. System Requirements

### Server Infrastructure
- Scalable cloud infrastructure (AWS/GCP/Azure)
- Load balancing for high availability
- Auto-scaling configuration
- CDN for static assets
- Memory requirements: 4GB+ RAM per instance
- CPU: 2+ vCPUs per instance
- Storage: SSD-backed storage for databases

### Database Requirements
- PostgreSQL via Supabase
- Minimum 50GB storage initially
- Backup frequency: Daily
- Read replicas for scaling
- Point-in-time recovery
- Connection pooling

### Scalability Considerations
- Horizontal scaling capability
- Microservices architecture
- Caching strategy (Redis)
- Database sharding preparation
- API rate limiting
- Load balancing across regions

### Performance Benchmarks
- Page load time: < 2 seconds
- API response time: < 200ms
- Database query time: < 100ms
- Concurrent users: 1000+
- Image loading time: < 1 second
- Transaction processing: < 3 seconds

## 2. Technology Stack

### Frontend
- React 18+ with TypeScript
- TailwindCSS for styling
- Framer Motion for animations
- ShadcnUI for components
- Redux Toolkit for state management

### Backend
- Node.js with Express
- TypeScript for type safety
- Supabase for database and auth
- Jest for testing
- Winston for logging
- Compression for response optimization
- Helmet for security headers

### Database
