# Disaster Recovery and Backup Plan

## Backup Strategy

### Database Backups
```json
{
  "schedule": {
    "full": "daily",
    "incremental": "hourly",
    "transaction_logs": "continuous"
  },
  "retention": {
    "daily": "7 days",
    "weekly": "4 weeks",
    "monthly": "12 months"
  },
  "storage": {
    "primary": "supabase-backups",
    "secondary": "aws-s3-backup",
    "archive": "azure-cold-storage"
  }
}
```

### File Storage Backups
```json
{
  "assets": {
    "schedule": "daily",
    "retention": "90 days",
    "versioning": true
  },
  "user_uploads": {
    "schedule": "hourly",
    "retention": "30 days",
    "versioning": true
  }
}
```

## Recovery Procedures

### Database Recovery
1. Stop application services
2. Verify backup integrity
3. Restore database backup
4. Apply transaction logs
5. Verify data consistency
6. Update connection strings
7. Restart application services

### File Storage Recovery
1. Identify affected files
2. Select appropriate backup
3. Restore to temporary location
4. Verify file integrity
5. Update file references
6. Migrate to production

## Disaster Scenarios

### Complete System Failure
1. Activate emergency response team
2. Assess damage extent
3. Initialize recovery plan
4. Restore from latest backup
5. Verify system integrity
6. Update DNS records
7. Monitor system stability

### Data Corruption
1. Isolate affected systems
2. Identify corruption source
3. Stop data synchronization
4. Restore from last known good backup
5. Verify data integrity
6. Resume normal operations

### Security Breach
1. Isolate compromised systems
2. Reset all credentials
3. Restore from pre-breach backup
4. Apply security patches
5. Update access controls
6. Document incident
7. Notify affected parties

## Testing Schedule

### Monthly Tests
- Backup integrity verification
- Recovery time objectives
- Data consistency checks
- System integration tests

### Quarterly Tests
- Full disaster recovery simulation
- Failover testing
- Cross-region recovery
- Data integrity validation

## Recovery Time Objectives (RTO)

```json
{
  "critical_systems": {
    "database": "1 hour",
    "api_services": "2 hours",
    "user_auth": "30 minutes"
  },
  "business_systems": {
    "admin_portal": "4 hours",
    "reporting": "8 hours",
    "analytics": "12 hours"
  }
}
```

## Recovery Point Objectives (RPO)

```json
{
  "transaction_data": "0 minutes",
  "user_data": "5 minutes",
  "analytics_data": "1 hour",
  "reporting_data": "4 hours"
}
```

## Communication Plan

### Internal Communication
1. Emergency contact list
2. Incident response team
3. Status update schedule
4. Recovery progress reports

### External Communication
1. Customer notification template
2. Status page updates
3. Social media updates
4. Support ticket management

## Documentation Requirements

### Incident Documentation
- Incident description
- Impact assessment
- Recovery steps taken
- Root cause analysis
- Prevention measures

### Recovery Documentation
- Backup restoration steps
- System verification checklist
- Data integrity checks
