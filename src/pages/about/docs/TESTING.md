# About Page Testing Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the testing workflow for the About page components, including performance monitoring, accessibility testing, and visual regression testing.

## Testing Utilities

### Performance Testing
- Monitors Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS)
- Tracks image loading performance
- Measures animation performance
- Monitors layout shifts

### Accessibility Testing
- ARIA label validation
- Keyboard navigation testing
- Screen reader compatibility
- Color contrast verification

### Visual Testing
- Spacing consistency
- Typography validation
- Responsive design testing
- Component alignment

## Running Tests

### Development Testing
Tests are automatically run when the About page loads in development:
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (containerRef.current) {
    runAboutPageTests(containerRef.current);
  }
}, []);
```

### Manual Testing
To test specific sections:
```typescript
testAboutSection('mission-vision-section');
```

## Test Results
Test results are logged to the console and displayed via toast notifications:
- ✅ Success notifications for passed tests
- ❌ Error notifications for failed tests
- Detailed console logs for debugging

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Performance Issues
1. Layout Shifts
   - Check for dynamic content loading
   - Verify image dimensions
   - Review animation timing

2. Slow Image Loading
   - Verify Cloudinary optimization
   - Check lazy loading implementation
   - Review image formats and sizes

### Visual Regressions
1. Spacing Inconsistencies
   - Review Tailwind classes
   - Check responsive breakpoints
   - Verify container padding

2. Typography Issues
   - Validate font scaling
   - Check line heights
   - Review text overflow handling

## Best Practices
1. Run tests after significant changes
2. Monitor console for warnings/errors
3. Address accessibility issues immediately
4. Test across multiple devices/browsers
5. Document new issues and solutions

## Maintenance
- Regular testing schedule
- Performance monitoring
- Accessibility audits
- Visual regression checks
